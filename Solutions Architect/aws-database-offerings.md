## Notes
### Cloud-Based Databases
#### Nature of Data
- Structured data
  - data that is organized in a way that is easily searchable
  - easy to analyze
  - difficult to change the structure
- Unstructured data
  - data that is not organized in a way that is easily searchable
  - files
- Semi-structured data
  - JSON files loaded into db engine
  - able to be analyzed

#### Relational Databases
- Data in stored in Tables
  - Entities
    - collection of data, in a table
  - Columns
    - attributes of the entity (Field)
  - Rows
    - individual records in the table (Record)

- Relationship between tables are build with keys
  - Primary Key
    - unique identifier for each row
  - Foreign Key
    - key that is used to link two tables together

#### Non-Relational Databases
- Semi-structured data
- Unstructured data
- OLTP web/mobile applications

- Database types
  - Key-Value
    - DynamoDB
    - Need to know the access patterns
  - Document
    - MongoDB
  - In-Memory
    - Redis
    - sub-millisecond latency
  - Graph
    - Neptune

- DynamoDB
  - ACID compliant
  - Point-in-time recovery
  - Global tables
  - millisecond latency
  - Table
    - partition key
      - unique identifier
      - location of data note
    - sort key
      - allows multiple items to be queried as a collection
    - Indexes (access data quickly)
      - local
        - uses the partition key with sort key
      - global
        - partition key and sort that can be different from the table
