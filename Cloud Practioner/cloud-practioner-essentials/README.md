### Introduction to Amazon Web Services
- Basic computing revolves around a client/server model
  - Client makes a request
  - Server processes the request and sends a response (w/wo the resource that was requested)
- Key concept of cloud computing is to only pay for what resources are used
  - On-demand services that are available 24/7 for as little or long as needed
- Definition: 
- **Cloud Computing** is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing

### Compute in the Cloud
#### EC2 Intro
  - highly flexible, cost effective, and quick
  - Multi-tenancy: multiple customers share the same physical hardware (but are isolated from each other)
    - Hypervisor: software that runs virtual machines and manages the physical hardware
  - Configurations
    - OS (windows, linux)
    - Software (web server, database)
    - 3rd party software
  - Vertically scaling
    - Increase the size of the instance (more CPU, memory, storage)
  - Horizontally scaling
    - Increase the number of instances
#### EC2 Instance Types
  - When selecting an instance type, consider the specific needs of your workloads and applications. This might include requirements for compute, memory, or storage capabilities.

### AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Basics
#### Exam Strategies
- Read the full question:
  - First, make sure that you read each question in full. Key words or phrases in the question that, if left unread, could result in you selecting an incorrect response option.
- Predict the answer before reviewing the response options
  - This strategy helps you to draw directly from your knowledge and skills without distraction from incorrect response options. If your prediction turns out to be one of the response options, this can be helpful for knowing whether youâ€™re on the right track. However, make sure that you review all the other response options for that question.
- Eliminate incorrect response options
  - Before selecting your response to a question, eliminate any options that you believe to be incorrect. 
  - This strategy helps you to focus on the correct option (or options, for multiple-response questions) and ensure that you have fulfilled all the requirements of the question.
