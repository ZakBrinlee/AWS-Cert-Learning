### Introduction to Amazon Web Services
- Basic computing revolves around a client/server model
  - Client makes a request
  - Server processes the request and sends a response (w/wo the resource that was requested)
- Key concept of cloud computing is to only pay for what resources are used
  - On-demand services that are available 24/7 for as little or long as needed
- Definition: 
- **Cloud Computing** is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing

### Compute in the Cloud
#### EC2 Intro
  - highly flexible, cost effective, and quick
  - Multitenancy: multiple customers share the same physical hardware (but are isolated from each other)
    - Hypervisor: software that runs virtual machines and manages the physical hardware
  - Configurations
    - OS (windows, linux)
    - Software (web server, database)
    - 3rd party software
  - Vertically scaling
    - Increase the size of the instance (more CPU, memory, storage)
  - Horizontally scaling
    - Increase the number of instances
#### EC2 Instance Types
  - When selecting an instance type, consider the specific needs of your workloads and applications. This might include requirements for compute, memory, or storage capabilities.
  - EC2 Instance families
    - **General Purpose**
      - Balanced resources
      - Diversity of workloads (web servers, dev environments, small databases)
    - **Compute Optimized**
      - Compute intensive workloads
      - High performance processors (Gaming servers, high performance computing, scientific modeling)
    - **Memory Optimized**
      - Memory intensive workloads
    - **Accelerated Computing**
      - Floating point number calculations
      - Graphics processing
      - Data pattern matching
      - Utilizes hardware accelerators
    - **Storage Optimized**
      - High performance for locally stored data
#### EC2 Pricing
- Purchase options
  - On-Demand
    - Pay for what you use by the time
  - Savings Plans
    - Commit to a consistent amount of usage (1 or 3 years)
  - Reserved
    - Steady workloads that require constant usage
    - Up front / partial up front / no up front
  - Spot
    - Bid on unused EC2 capacity
    - Can be terminated at any time (2 min warning if AWS takes it back)

    - Physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use
#### Scaling EC2
- Adjusting the capacity of the EC2 instances automatically based on demand
- Scale up
  - Add more power to the instance that is being used
- Scale out
  - Increase the amount of instances being used

#### Directing Traffic w Elastic Load Balancing
- Acts as a host at a resturant to direct customers to the right server
- Load Balancer: distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, in multiple availability zones
- Elastic Load Balancing
  - regional construct (runs at region level)
  - operates between aws services
  - single point of contact for all incoming web traffic

- Network Access Controls Lists
  - Tells the network which traffic is allowed and which is denied at the SUBNET level
  - Checked on the way in and the way out
  - Just detects the access to the subnet, not the resources within the subnet
- Security Groups are used to control access to resources
  - Can be used to control traffic flow by the type of traffic (HTTP, OS requests, etc)
  - Think of it as the doorman to the security group resources
  - Stateful and keeps track of who can/cannot access
